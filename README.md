# Image_caption_generator

This project uses deep learning techniques to process and analyze image and/or text data using TensorFlow and Keras. The workflow integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with text processing layers (e.g., LSTM/BiLSTM) to potentially perform multimodal classification or captioning tasks.
